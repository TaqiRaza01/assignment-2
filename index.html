        <h2>Semantic Elements</h2>


        <!-- FIRST Paragraph -->

        <p>
            &emsp; &emsp; When building web pages, we use a combination of non-semantic <b>HTML</b>
            <br> and
            Semantic <b>HTML</b>. The word
            semantic means
            <b><i> "relating to meaning",</i></b> so
            <br>
             semantic elements provide information about the content
            between the
            <br>
             opening
            and closing tags.
        </p>

        <!-- SECOND  Paragraph -->
        <p>
            &emsp; &emsp; By using Semantic <b>HTML</b>, we select <b>HTML</b> elements based on their
            <br>
            meaning, not on
            how they are
            presented. Elements such as
            <code> <b> &lt;div&gt;</b></code>

            and

            <br>

            <code> <b>  &lt;span&gt; </b> </code>

            are not semantic elements since
            they provide no context as to what is
            <br>
            
            inside of those tags.
        </p>


        <!-- THIRD Paragraph -->
        <p>
            For example, instead of using a
            <code> <b> &lt;div&gt;</b></code> element to contain our header
            <br>
             information, we could use a
            <code> <b> &lt;header&gt;</b></code> element, which is used as a heading

            <br>


            section. By using a <code> <b> &lt;header&gt;</b></code> tag instead of a <code> <b> &lt;div&gt;</b></code>,
            we provide context as to
            
            <br>


            what information is inside
            of the opening and closing tag.
        </p>




        <!-- 2ND PART OF MAIN SECTION -->

        <h2>Why Use Semantic Elements?</h2>

        <ul>


            <li><b>Availability:</b> &nbsp;Semantic <b>HTML</b> makes webpages accessible for mobile <br>
                
                devices and for
                people
                with
                disabilities as well. This is because screen
                <br>
                
                readers and browsers are able to interpret the code better.
            </li>


            <li><b>SEO:</b> &nbsp;It improves the website <b>SEO</b>, or <b>S</b>earch <b>E</b>ngine
                <b>O</b>ptimization, which
                
                
                <br>
                
                
                is the process of
                increasing the number of people that visit your
                
                
                <br>
                
                
                webpage. With better <b>SEO</b>, search engines are
                better able
                to identify the

                
                <br>



                
                content of your website and weight the most important content



                <br>




                appropriately.
            </li>



            <li><b>Easy to Understand:</b>&nbsp; Semantic <b>HTML</b> also makes the website's source
                
                
                <br>



                
                code easier to
                read for
                other web developers.</li>
        </ul>


        <!-- FOUTH PARAGRAPH -->
        <p>
            &emsp;
            To better understand this, you can think of comparing non-semantic <b>HTML</b> 
            
            
            <br>


            
            to going into a store with no
            signs
            on the aisles. Since the aisles aren't labeled, 
            
            
            <br>



            you don't know what products are in those aisles. However,
            stores that do
            
            
            
            
            <br>




            have signs for each aisle make it a lot easier to find the items you need, just
            
            
            
            
            <br>




            like Semantic
            <b>HTML</b>.
        </p>

        <!-- FIFTH PARAGRAPH -->
        <P>
            &emsp;Many web sites contain <b>HTML</b> code like:<code> <b> &lt;div id="header"&gt;</b></code>,
            <code> <b> &lt;div
                <br>
                 id="nav"&gt;</b></code>, <code> <b> &lt;div id="main"&gt;</b></code>,
            <code> <b> &lt;div id="footer"&gt;</b></code> to indicate
            
            
            <br>

            
            
            header, navigation, main
            content and footer.
